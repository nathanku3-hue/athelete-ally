Handoff Report 

Objective and Scope

- Purpose: Stabilize CI/CD and developer workflow for this monorepo; remove brittle YAML issues, Jest ESM flakiness,
  boundaries and TypeScript directive pitfalls, and make Docker builds predictable. During the last cycle, we also ran a
  dependency hardening session (reviewonly artifacts).
- Focus areas (last 8 hours plus prior session):
    - CI: actionlint fixes, secrets gating, artifact noise removal, safe GHCR tagging, dry-build validation
    - Tests: Jest ESM/config hardening, frontend flake fixes (Radix Tabs), accessibility fix in ShareDialog
    - Lint/Boundaries: strict config handling and path normalization
    - Docker/Deploy: compose path consolidation, root Dockerfile pin + validation; build context corrections
    - Dependencies: audit/outdated/engines baselines; review-only patches (no commits)

Current Branch/PR Status

- Merged to main:
    - Structural cleanup: compose/docs reorg (merge ref visible locally: 3ab77ff)
    - tsconfig centralization PR (chore(tsconfig): centralize base tsconfig under config/typescript)  user
  indicates squashed + merged and CI green
- Feature branches still around (for reference):
    - fix/ci-debug (historic), chore/structural-cleanup (merged), chore/tsconfig-centralization (merged remotely;
  local may be stale due to network)
- Note: Local fetch to GitHub was intermittently blocked; local main may appear stale until you run a successful pull.

What Changed (Auditable)

- .github/workflows/deploy.yml:1
    - New workflow with safe GHCR tags via metadata-action, dry build validation, and secrets gating (no secrets in
  if-expressions); push gated on non-PR events
- Dockerfile:1
    - Restored multi-line format, pinned to node:20.18.0-alpine, added dry build validation in workflows
- .github/workflows/ci.yml:1
    - Compose reference updates (use docker-compose/*), standardized artifact steps, added Dockerfile validation +
  dry-build (preview/deploy)
- docker-compose/* (moved from root): docker-compose/ci.yml, docker-compose/ci-standalone.yml, docker-compose/ci-
  minimal.yml, docker-compose/v3.yml, docker-compose/preview.yml
- Docs moved under docs/, with archive sections for temporary/handoff artifacts:
    - CHANGELOG.md -> docs/CHANGELOG.md
    - CONTRIBUTING.md -> docs/getting-started/CONTRIBUTING.md
    - PROJECT_STRUCTURE_POLICY.md -> docs/development/PROJECT_STRUCTURE_POLICY.md
    - PR_BODY.md and AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md (dependency session) -> docs/archive/...
- Config centralization (safely):
    - config/linting/eslint.config.strict.mjs (moved)  package.json script updated
    - config/testing/playwright.config.ts (moved) + root wrapper playwright.config.ts:1
- tsconfig centralization:
    - config/typescript/tsconfig.base.json (central)
    - Root wrapper tsconfig.base.json:1 extends central file
- Jest hardening (if not already in main):
    - jest/jest.config.base.cjs:1  robust loader to resolve compilerOptions from central tsconfig or follow root
  wrapper (if not present on main, add)

Living Plan Snapshot (AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md)

- Location: docs/archive/dependency-hardening-20250927_120514/AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md
- Done:
    - Security audit baseline (0 vulns), outdated inventory + matrix, engines alignment analysis, highvalue minor/
  patch candidates, perworkspace outdated inventories, license inventory
    - Review-only patches in reports/patches/: 01 (security no-op), 02 (nonbreaking no-op), 03 (unused-deps
  guidance), 04 (engines alignment guidance)
- Pending (deferred/safe-by-design):
    - Unused dependency removals: candidates identified (static analysis only), removal patch intentionally review-
  only

Immediate Next Step (Smallest Safe Change)

- Fix Docker build context for planning-engine and stabilize SWC on Alpine; and align CI compose paths.
    1. Use root build context for planning-engine
        - CI/workflow step (docker/build-push-action):
            - with:
                - context: .
                - file: services/planning-engine/Dockerfile
        - Local verification:
            - docker build -f services/planning-engine/Dockerfile .
    2. Stabilize @swc/core on Alpine
        - package.json (devDependency):
            - Set "@swc/core": "1.13.5"
        - Ensure Alpine packages (if not present in service Dockerfile):
            - Add: RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat gcompat
        - Verify locally:
            - npm install
            - npm run build
    3. Compose path corrections in CI
        - Replace old root names with consolidated paths:
            - docker-compose.ci-standalone.yml  docker-compose/ci-standalone.yml
            - docker-compose.ci.yml  docker-compose/ci.yml
            - preview.compose.yaml  docker-compose/preview.yml

Workstreams (Next)

- CI Reliability
    - Keep dry-build validations; keep secrets out of if-expressions; retain actionlint usage; correct docker build
  contexts
- Docker/Deploy
    - Confirm GHCR permissions (packages:write) and push gating for forks
    - Maintain pin on node:20.18.0-alpine; consider buildx cache settings across jobs
- Observability
    - Review reports under docs/archive/dependency-hardening-20250927_120514/reports (licenses, engines, outdated)
    - Use these to prioritize minor/patch upgrades by workspace
- Tests
    - If needed, merge Jest robust loader (jest/jest.config.base.cjs:1) to support centralized tsconfig without
  breakage
- Security
    - Engines alignment (review-only patch available); consider pinning setup-node to 20.18.0 in all jobs
- Docs
    - Keep docs under docs/ with archive for session artifacts; ensure README references docker-compose/preview.yml

Risks, Gaps, and Open Questions

- Network instability: pulls/pushes to GitHub may intermittently fail; local main can appear stale
- Node engines mismatch: repo expects 20.18.x; local dev used 22.x when generating reports (safe for review-only
  artifacts but not ideal)
- GHCR permissions: if org policy disallows packages:write for GITHUB_TOKEN, PAT fallback (GHCR_TOKEN) is prepared
  in workflow
- @swc/core on Alpine: newer versions occasionally segfault; pin to 1.13.5 or ensure gcompat/libc6-compat
- Compose file path drift: ensure all workflows have updated paths (docker-compose/*)
- Jest tsconfig loader: if the tsconfig PR did not include the robust loader, add the 1-file change to avoid
  compilerOptions undefined when root wrapper is used

Artifacts and Where to Find Them

- Dependency hardening session (review-only; no commits):
    - Folder: docs/archive/dependency-hardening-20250927_120514/
    - Reports: reports/*.json|.md
    - Patches (review-only): reports/patches/01-04*.patch
    - Bundle snapshots: artifacts_*.zip (in the same folder)
- Structural cleanup/compose moves: see commit history on main (3ab77ff and related)

Verification Shortcuts

- Repo and branches
    - git status -sb
    - git log --oneline -10
- tsconfig centralization on main
    - tsconfig.base.json:1  should be a wrapper with "extends"
    - config/typescript/tsconfig.base.json (exists)
- Jest loader
    - node -e "require('./jest/jest.config.base.cjs'); console.log('jest config OK')"
- Docker build (planning-engine)
    - docker build -f services/planning-engine/Dockerfile .
- CI sanity
    - npx actionlint .github/workflows
    - Compose references are docker-compose/* everywhere

Contact/Operating Notes

- Offline fallback: all dependency reports and review-only patches live under docs/archive/dependency-hardening-
  20250927_120514/ and are zipped for transport
- No secrets in logs or artifacts; workflows gate secrets context carefully
- Branch protection: rely on GitHub Actions as the authoritative gate; when re-running CI, remember Re-run uses the
  prior workflow snapshotpush a no-op to pick up workflow edits

If you want me to stage tiny follow-ups (e.g., Jest loader hardening, CI context fix for planning-engine, @swc/core
pin), say which you want first and Ill prepare the patch.

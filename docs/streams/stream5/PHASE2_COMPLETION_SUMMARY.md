### API Endpoints
- **Public:**
  - `GET /v1/plans/:id/coach-tip` - Get coaching tip for a plan
  - `GET /v1/coach-tips/:tipId` - Get tip by ID
  - `GET /v1/users/:userId/coach-tips` - Get all user tips

- **Internal:**
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `GET /info` - Service information
  - `GET /subscriber/status` - Subscriber status
  - `GET /v1/coach-tips/stats` - Storage statistics
  - `POST /v1/coach-tips/cleanup` - Cleanup expired tips

## ✅ Verification Results

### Test Suite Execution
```bash
# All tests PASSED ✅

1. Redis Connection Test
   ✅ Connected to Redis at localhost:6379
   ✅ Redis operations working
   ✅ Cleanup completed

2. Functional Test  
   ✅ Tip generation logic functional
   ✅ Redis storage with TTL working
   ✅ Tip retrieval by planId working
   ✅ Redis key structure correct (tipKeys: 1, planKeys: 1)
   ✅ TTL verification: 167 hours (7 days)
   ✅ Storage statistics available

3. Component Verification
   ✅ High performance tips generated correctly
   ✅ Low safety tips prioritized appropriately (high priority)
   ✅ Compliance issues addressed with helpful actions
   ✅ Fallback tips work when scoring unavailable
   ✅ Scoring context preserved in tip payload
```

### Infrastructure Validation
- **Redis:** localhost:6379 (compose-redis-1) - ✅ Connected
- **NATS:** localhost:4223 (compose-nats-1) - ✅ Available
- **Event Bus:** @athlete-ally/event-bus - ✅ Integrated

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Event-Driven Flow
```
Plan Generation (planning-engine)
       ↓
plan_generated event + enriched planData.scoring
       ↓
CoachTip Subscriber (services/coach-tip-service)
       ↓
Extract scoring data (safety, compliance, performance)
       ↓
CoachTipGenerator.generateTips() → CoachTipPayload
       ↓
TipStorage.storeTip() → Redis (7-day TTL)
       ↓
API: GET /v1/plans/:id/coach-tip → Frontend
```

### Tip Generation Logic

**Safety Factor:**
- Score < 70: High priority safety warning
- Score < 85: Medium priority form guidance

**Compliance Factor:**
- Score < 75: High priority schedule adjustment
- Score < 90: Medium priority planning recommendation

**Performance Factor:**
- Score ≥ 90: Low priority optimization tip
- Score < 75: Medium priority variety enhancement

**Overall Score:**
- Score ≥ 90: Low priority general encouragement
- Score < 70: High priority guidance recommendation

TTL: 7 days (604,800 seconds)
Database: 0 (default) or configurable
```

### Example Tip Response
```json
{
  "id": "tip-plan-12345-1234567890",
  "planId": "plan-12345",
  "userId": "user-123",
  "message": "Your plan has several safety concerns...",
  "type": "safety",
  "priority": "high",
  "action": {
    "actionType": "modify_plan",
    "data": { "suggestion": "reduce_volume", "weeks": [1, 2] }

##  Next Steps: Gateway Integration

### Required Actions
1. **API Gateway Configuration**
   - Add route: `GET /v1/plans/:id/coach-tip`
   - Proxy to: `http://localhost:4103/v1/plans/:id/coach-tip`
   - Add authentication/authorization middleware

2. **Service Registration**
   - Register coach-tip-service in service discovery
   - Configure load balancing if needed
   - Add health check monitoring

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Frontend already has:
     - ✅ `CoachTipPayload` type definitions
     - ✅ API hooks (`useCoachTip`)
     - ✅ UI components (`CoachTipCard`, `CoachTipAdapter`)
   - Just wire the API endpoint

4. **Testing**
   - End-to-end flow: Plan generation → Event → Tip generation → API retrieval
   - Frontend integration testing
   - Performance/load testing

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **EventBus vs EventProcessor:** CoachTip service uses `EventBus` directly from `@athlete-ally/event-bus`, while planning-engine has a custom `EventProcessor` wrapper. Both patterns work; chose EventBus for simplicity.

2. **Redis TTL Management:** Implemented automatic TTL based on tip expiration date, plus hourly cleanup task for safety.

3. **Test Strategy:** Three-tier approach (unit → functional → integration) allowed fast iteration and confidence in real infrastructure.

4. **Scoring Integration:** Event payload enrichment approach keeps services decoupled while enabling data flow.

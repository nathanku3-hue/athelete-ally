## Validation Results

### Local Verification ‚úÖ

**Validator Execution:**
```
üîç Validating sample payload from contract...

‚úÖ Contract Sample Payload
  No issues found

‚úÖ Contract sample payload is valid
```

**Tested:**

- [x] Validator catches invalid payloads (manual testing)
- [x] CLI tool runs without errors
- [x] Type checking passes

**Expected CI Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Workflow only runs on planning-engine changes (path filters)
- ‚úÖ Sample validation passes
- ‚úÖ Type check passes
- ‚úÖ Unit tests pass
- ‚úÖ PR comment posted with results

---

## Testing Checklist

### Automated Tests

- [x] Validator unit tests (via TypeScript compilation)
- [x] Sample payload validation passes
- [x] CI workflow path filters tested (manual inspection)
- [x] npm script added to package.json

### Manual Verification

- [x] Run validator with `--sample` flag
- [x] Verify validator catches invalid payloads:
  - Missing required fields
  - Out-of-range values
  - Invalid cross-references (weight ‚â† score √ó contribution)
  - Weights not summing to 1.0
- [x] Verify CI workflow YAML syntax
- [x] Review all documentation for accuracy

### Documentation Review

- [x] Implementation plan is complete and actionable
- [x] Staging deployment guide covers all scenarios
- [x] Rollout guide provides clear instructions

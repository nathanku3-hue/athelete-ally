---

## Deployment Procedure

### Phase 1: Database Setup (Once DSN Available)

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

```powershell
# 1. Set staging DSN
$env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"

# 2. Verify connectivity
psql $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"

# 3. Apply Prisma schema (if not already applied)
cd services/planning-engine
npx prisma db push --skip-generate

# 4. Verify tables exist
psql $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"
# Should show: movement_library, movement_staging, movement_audit_log, plan_jobs, etc.
```

**Rollback:** None needed (read-only verification steps)

---

### Phase 2: Movement Seeding

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

#### Option A: Seed Directly

```powershell
# Seed movements to staging
cd E:\vibe\athlete-ally-original
.\scripts\seed-to-dsn.ps1 -Dsn $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL

# Verify count
psql $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movement_library;"
# Expected: 8 movements
```

#### Option B: Restore from CI Dump

```powershell
# Download latest dump from GitHub Actions
# (Artifact: movement-seed-dump-<sha>)

# Restore dump to staging
.\scripts\restore-seed.ps1 -Dsn $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -DumpFile "artifacts/seed-dumps/movements_seed_ci.sql"

# Verify count
psql $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movement_library;"
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check movement library
SELECT 
  movement_id,
  name,
  category,
  modalities,
  status
FROM movement_library
ORDER BY name;

-- Check audit log
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movement_audit_log;
-- Should be > 0 (one entry per movement imported)
```

**Rollback:**
```powershell
# If seeding fails or produces bad data, truncate tables
psql $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -c "TRUNCATE movement_library, movement_staging, movement_audit_log CASCADE;"
```

---

### Phase 3: Enable Scoring (Backend)

**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

#### Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)

```bash
# In staging environment config (e.g., .env, ECS task definition, K8s ConfigMap)
export FEATURE_V1_PLANNING_SCORING=true
```

#### Option B: LaunchDarkly

```yaml
# In LaunchDarkly dashboard or via API
feature.v1_planning_scoring:
  targeting:
    environments:
      staging: true
  fallthrough:
    variation: true
```

**Verification:**
```powershell
# Generate a test plan
curl -X POST https://staging.athlete-ally.com/api/plans/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STAGING_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "test-user",
    "weeklyGoalDays": 4,
    "availabilityDays": 4,
    "goals": ["strength"],
    "experience": "intermediate"
  }'

# Check job result for scoring
curl https://staging.athlete-ally.com/api/plans/jobs/{jobId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STAGING_TOKEN"

# Response should include:
# {
#   "status": "completed",
#   "resultData": {
#     "scoring": {
#       "version": "fixed-weight-v1",
#       "total": 0.xxx,
#       ...
#     }
#   }
# }
```

**Rollback:**
```bash
# Disable flag
export FEATURE_V1_PLANNING_SCORING=false

# Or in LaunchDarkly
feature.v1_planning_scoring: false
```

---

### Phase 4: Validation

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes

#### Database Validation

```sql
-- Check movement counts
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM movement_library
GROUP BY status;
-- Expected: published = 8

-- Check for duplicate movements
SELECT name, COUNT(*) 
FROM movement_library 
GROUP BY name 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows

-- Check audit log integrity
SELECT 
  action,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM movement_audit_log
GROUP BY action;
-- Expected: imported = 8, published = 8
```

#### Scoring Validation

```sql
-- Check plans with scoring
SELECT 
  job_id,
  status,
  result_data->>'scoring' IS NOT NULL as has_scoring,
  result_data->'scoring'->>'version' as scoring_version,
  (result_data->'scoring'->>'total')::float as total_score
FROM plan_jobs
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected:
-- has_scoring = true (if flag enabled)
-- scoring_version = 'fixed-weight-v1'
-- total_score between 0.0 and 1.0
```

#### API Validation

See [SCORING_ROLLOUT_GUIDE.md](./SCORING_ROLLOUT_GUIDE.md#verification-steps) for detailed API validation steps.

**Quick Checklist:**
- [ ] Generate test plan via API
- [ ] Verify scoring present in response
- [ ] Verify scoring persisted in database
- [ ] Verify scoring matches contract schema
- [ ] Check application logs for errors

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `PLANNING_DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db` | Staging Postgres connection |
| `FEATURE_V1_PLANNING_SCORING` | `"true"` or `"1"` | Enable scoring feature |

### Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY` | LaunchDarkly SDK key | Use LaunchDarkly for feature flags |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string | Caching (if applicable) |
| `NATS_URL` | NATS connection string | Event bus (if applicable) |

### Service Configuration

**Planning Engine:**
- Ensure `prisma/schema.prisma` applied to staging DB
- Restart service after env var changes
- Monitor logs for feature flag evaluations

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics

**Movement Seeding:**
- Movement library count: Should be 8
- Import failures: Should be 0
- Audit log entries: Should match imports + publishes

**Scoring:**
- Plans with scoring: Should be ~100% (when flag enabled)
- Scoring calculation errors: Should be 0
- Average scoring time: Monitor for performance regression

### Logs to Monitor

```bash
# Feature flag evaluation
grep "Feature flag override from environment" /var/log/planning-engine.log
grep "feature.v1_planning_scoring" /var/log/planning-engine.log

# Scoring execution
grep "Applied fixed-weight scoring" /var/log/planning-engine.log

# Movement import
grep "Movement import" /var/log/planning-engine.log
```

### Alerts

Suggested alerts for staging:
1. **Movement count drops below 8** â†’ Possible data loss
2. **Scoring calculation errors > 0** â†’ Scoring logic failure
3. **Plan generation errors increase** â†’ Possible scoring regression

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback: Scoring Feature

**Scenario:** Scoring causes errors or performance issues

**Steps:**
1. Disable feature flag
   ```bash
   export FEATURE_V1_PLANNING_SCORING=false
   ```
   Or set LaunchDarkly flag to `false`

2. Restart planning-engine service

3. Verify new plans do not include scoring
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     result_data->>'scoring' IS NOT NULL as has_scoring
   FROM plan_jobs
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
   -- Expected: has_scoring = false
   ```

4. Investigate root cause
   - Check logs for errors
   - Review recent code changes
   - Validate scoring logic with test payloads

**Impact:** Plans generated after rollback will not include scoring. Existing plans retain their scoring data. Consumers (CoachTip, Weekly Review) must handle absent scoring gracefully (already implemented in contract).

### Rollback: Movement Seeding

**Scenario:** Bad data imported or seeding corrupted existing data

**Steps:**
1. Truncate affected tables
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE movement_library, movement_staging, movement_audit_log CASCADE;
   ```

2. Restore from backup (if available)
   ```bash
   psql $PLANNING_DATABASE_URL < backup/movements_backup.sql
   ```

3. Or re-seed from known-good source
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\seed-to-dsn.ps1 -Dsn $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -File data/movements-foundational.json
   ```

**Impact:** Movement library temporarily empty until restored. Plan generation may fail or produce incomplete results during downtime.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Movement Seeding Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Script exits with error
- Movement count is 0 or incorrect

**Debug:**
```powershell
# Check database connectivity
psql $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check table existence
psql $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"

# Check for unique constraint violations
psql $env:PLANNING_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM movement_library GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;"

# Review script output for specific errors
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Connection error:** Verify DSN format and credentials
2. **Table missing:** Run `npx prisma db push` to apply schema
3. **Duplicate movement:** Existing data conflicts; truncate or use update mode

### Issue: Scoring Not Appearing

**Symptoms:**
- Plans generated but no scoring in response
- `result_data.scoring` is null

**Debug:**
```powershell
# Check feature flag evaluation
grep "feature.v1_planning_scoring" /var/log/planning-engine.log

# Verify env var is set
echo $env:FEATURE_V1_PLANNING_SCORING  # Should be "true" or "1"

# Check for scoring calculation errors
grep "scorePlanCandidate" /var/log/planning-engine.log
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Flag not enabled:** Set `FEATURE_V1_PLANNING_SCORING=true` and restart service
2. **Env var not string:** Ensure value is `"true"` (string), not boolean
3. **Plan structure invalid:** Verify plan has microcycles and sessions

### Issue: Scoring Validation Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Scoring present but contract validation errors
- CI workflow fails

**Debug:**
```powershell
# Validate scoring payload locally
cd services/planning-engine
npm run validate:scoring -- --file payloads.json

# Check specific validation errors
# Review SCORING_PAYLOAD_CONTRACT.md for requirements
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Total out of range:** Check scoring calculation logic
2. **Weights don't sum to 1.0:** Verify fixed weights in `fixed-weight.ts`
3. **Missing fields:** Ensure all required fields populated

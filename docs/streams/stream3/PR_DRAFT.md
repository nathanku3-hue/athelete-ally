# PR: Stream 3 UI Integration - CoachTip & Weekly Review Prototypes

## Summary

This PR integrates the **Stream 3 UI prototype variants** for **CoachTip** and **Weekly Review** components into the production application. The implementation includes:

- üé® **Two UI variants** for both CoachTip (A: Traditional Tooltip, B: Modern Card) and Weekly Review (A: Dashboard, B: Visual Story)
- üö© **Feature flag system** for runtime variant switching (localStorage-based, LaunchDarkly-ready)
- üìä **Telemetry integration** tracking user interactions (show/dismiss/accept for CoachTip, show/apply for Weekly Review)
- ‚ôø **WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility** compliance (keyboard nav, ARIA, color contrast)
- üì± **Responsive design** (mobile-first, tested 375px‚Äì1920px)
- üìñ **Adapter pattern** for clean separation between backend API types and UI variants
- üìù **Onboarding copy variants** (A: Technical/Data-driven, B: Personalized/Adaptive)

### Final Variant Selections (Post Product/Design Review)

- **CoachTip**: Variant B (Modern Card) selected for production
- **Weekly Review**: Hybrid model (Variant B visual + Variant A data table)
- **Onboarding Copy**: Variant B (Personalized/Adaptive messaging)

See `docs/streams/stream3/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` for detailed rationale.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Storybook Review
```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm run storybook

# Navigate to: Stream3 ‚Üí CoachTip, WeeklyReview, VariantSwitcher
# Verify all stories render without errors
# Run a11y addon checks
```

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser to plan detail page
# Verify CoachTip renders with Variant B (gradient card)
# Click action button ‚Üí Check Network tab for telemetry POST
# Click dismiss ‚Üí Verify event fires

# Navigate to weekly review page
# Verify WeeklyReview renders with Variant B (visual story)
# Click "View Full Analysis" ‚Üí Check telemetry POST
```

### 3. Feature Flag Toggle
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem('featureVariant_coachTip', 'A'); // Switch to Variant A
localStorage.setItem('featureVariant_coachTip', 'B'); // Switch to Variant B
location.reload(); // Refresh to see changes
```

### 4. Accessibility Check
- Tab through components ‚Üí Verify visible focus rings
- Test with screen reader (NVDA/VoiceOver) ‚Üí Verify announcements
- Check keyboard shortcuts: Enter/Space should activate buttons
- Run Lighthouse audit: Aim for Accessibility ‚â•95

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Device emulation ‚Üí iPhone SE (375px)
- Verify components adapt correctly (no horizontal scroll)
- Test tablet (768px) and desktop (1920px) breakpoints

## QA Testing Checklist

See **`docs/streams/stream3/README.md` ‚Üí Integration Checklist for QA** for full testing guide.

**Key tests:**
- [ ] CoachTip displays correctly on plan detail page
- [ ] CoachTip telemetry fires on show/dismiss/accept
- [ ] Weekly Review displays correctly on weekly review page
- [ ] Weekly Review telemetry fires on show/apply
- [ ] Feature flags toggle variants correctly
- [ ] Accessibility passes (keyboard nav, screen reader, contrast)
- [ ] Mobile responsive layouts verified
- [ ] Storybook stories all render
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Lighthouse scores: Performance ‚â•90, Accessibility ‚â•95

---

## Breaking Changes

**None.** This PR is **additive only**. Existing UI components are not modified. The new components are:
- Rendered conditionally via feature flags
- Backward-compatible with existing backend API contracts
- Isolated in `components/stream3/` namespace

**Migration Path**: To fully adopt the new UI, update pages to use:
```tsx
// Old (still works)
import { CoachTipCard } from '@/components/coach-tip/CoachTipCard';

// New (recommended)
import { CoachTipAdapter } from '@/components/coach-tip/CoachTipAdapter';
```

---

## Performance Impact

**Minimal.** New components add:
- ~15KB gzipped (Tailwind CSS classes, Lucide icons)
- No new third-party dependencies
- Lazy-loaded via Next.js dynamic imports (if configured)
- Telemetry calls are fire-and-forget with error handling

**Lighthouse Metrics (Expected)**:
- Performance: 90-95 (no impact)
- Accessibility: 95-100 (improved)
- Best Practices: 90-95 (no impact)

---

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ **No PII in telemetry**: Only `userId`, `planId`, `tipId`, `reviewId` (UUIDs, no names/emails)
- ‚úÖ **Client-only components**: No server-side rendering of sensitive data
- ‚úÖ **Feature flags in localStorage**: No server-side persistence (yet), safe for prototyping
- ‚úÖ **Input sanitization**: All user-facing text is sanitized via React's built-in XSS protection
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS-only telemetry**: All API calls use HTTPS in production

---

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Current PR)
- Deploy to **staging** with feature flags **off** by default
- QA team runs full integration checklist
- Product/Design team reviews in staging
- Fix any critical bugs

### Phase 2: Canary Release
- Enable flags for **10% of users** via LaunchDarkly
- Monitor telemetry for errors, engagement metrics
- Collect user feedback
- Iterate on design/copy if needed

### Phase 3: Full Rollout
- Enable flags for **100% of users**
- Set default variant to Variant B for both components
- Remove Variant A code (or keep for future A/B tests)
- Remove VariantSwitcher dev tool

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- Deprecate old CoachTipCard/WeeklyReviewCard components
- Migrate all pages to use Adapter components
- Remove feature flag code once winner is clear
- Archive Storybook stories for non-selected variants

---

## Dependencies

**No new external dependencies.** All new code uses existing project dependencies:
- React 18
- Next.js 14
- Tailwind CSS 3
- TypeScript 5
- Lucide React (icons)

## Questions / Discussion

**For Reviewers:**
1. Should we enable Variant B by default for all new users, or start with 50/50 split?
2. Do we need server-side feature flag management before rollout, or is localStorage sufficient for Phase 1?
3. Should we track additional telemetry events (e.g., scroll depth on Weekly Review, time spent reading tips)?

**For QA:**
- Any specific edge cases you want tested beyond the checklist?
- Preferred browser/device matrix for cross-browser testing?

## Additional Context

This work was completed as part of **Stream 3: UI Prototypes**, aimed at enabling rapid UX experimentation without backend changes. The adapter pattern allows us to:
- Keep backend contracts stable
- Swap UI variants without touching API code
- A/B test designs with real user data
- Gradually migrate to winning variants

See full context in `docs/streams/stream3/README.md`.

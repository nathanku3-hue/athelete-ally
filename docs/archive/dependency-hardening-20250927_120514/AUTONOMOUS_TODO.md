| 2 | **Generate Low-Risk Security Update Patch** | [ ] To Do | `npm install` and `npm run test` pass after applying the patch. | `reports/patches/01-security-updates.patch` generated. `TECHNICAL_DEBT_LOG.md` updated with any unfixed vulnerabilities. |
| 3 | **Generate Non-Breaking Dependency Update Patch** | [ ] To Do | `npm install` and `npm run test` pass after applying the patch. | `reports/patches/02-non-breaking-updates.patch` generated. |
| 4 | **Generate Unused Dependency Removal Patch** | [ ] To Do | `npm install` and `npm run build` pass after applying the patch. Application functions correctly. | `reports/patches/03-remove-unused-deps.patch` generated. |

| 6 | **Lockfile Hygiene & Engines Alignment** | [ ] To Do | Root and workspace engines match Node v20.18.x; lockfile integrity verified via `npm ci`. | Report entry in `TECHNICAL_DEBT_LOG.md`; optional `reports/engines.txt`. |
| 7 | **Workspace Outdated Matrix** | [ ] To Do | Per-workspace outdated inventory generated. | `reports/outdated-matrix.json` created. |
| 8 | **Security Baseline Snapshot** | [ ] To Do | Summary of advisories with severities and paths captured. | `reports/audit-summary.md` created. |







## Session Notes
- Node/npm runtime: node v22.19.0, npm 11.5.2; repo engines expect node 20.18.x. Proceeded without CI gating; no installs were blocked.
- Security audit: 0 vulnerabilities (reports/audit.json); created audit-summary (reports/audit-summary.md).
- Outdated inventory: generated per-package and per-workspace matrices (reports/outdated.json, reports/outdated-matrix.json).
- Non-breaking updates: none available within semver ranges across workspaces; produced no-op patch.
- Unused dependencies: deferred full scan (npx depcheck timeouts in this environment); created placeholder plan in reports/unused.txt.

| 10 | **Top-Level License Inventory** | [x] Done | licenses.top-level.json exists and parses. | reports/licenses.top-level.json |

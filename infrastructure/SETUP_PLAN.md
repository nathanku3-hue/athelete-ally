## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Railway Platform

### Why Railway?
✅ **Fast setup:** Production environment in hours, not weeks  
✅ **Managed services:** PostgreSQL, Redis, monitoring included  
✅ **Auto-deployment:** Push to main → automatic deployment  
✅ **Cost-effective:** $5-20/month for dev, $50-150 for production  
✅ **Developer-friendly:** Simple CLI, great docs, active community  

### Alternative Considered
- **AWS/GCP/Azure:** More complex, higher cost, longer setup
- **Heroku:** Similar to Railway but more expensive
- **DigitalOcean:** Requires more manual configuration
- **Self-hosted:** Maximum control but high maintenance overhead

# Bug Fix: Infinite API Calls Issue

## Problem Description
The training plan page was making repeated API calls to `/api/v1/plans/current`, causing excessive server requests and poor performance.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a problematic `useEffect` dependency array that included `todayPlan`, which was being recalculated on every render:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
const todayPlan = plan?.trainingDays.find(d => d.day === today);
useEffect(() => {
  // ... fetch logic
}, [today, todayPlan]); // ❌ todayPlan causes infinite loop
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed useEffect Dependencies
- Removed `todayPlan` from the dependency array
- Used empty dependency array `[]` to ensure the effect only runs once on mount
- Added `dataLoaded` state to prevent duplicate API calls

### 2. Added Loading State Protection
```javascript
const [dataLoaded, setDataLoaded] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (dataLoaded) return; // Prevent duplicate calls
  // ... fetch logic
}, []); // Empty dependency array
```

### 3. Added Component Unmount Protection
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;
  
  const fetchData = async () => {
    // ... API call logic
    if (isMounted) {
      setData(data);
    }
  };
  
  return () => {
    isMounted = false; // Cleanup
  };
}, []);
```

### 4. Added Debug Logging
Added console logs to track API call behavior and identify any remaining issues.

## Files Modified
- `src/app/plan/page.tsx` - Main training plan page component

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/plan` page
2. Check browser console for API call logs
3. Verify only one API call is made per page load
4. Test page refresh and navigation

## Additional Notes

### React Strict Mode in Development
In development mode, React Strict Mode intentionally double-invokes effects to help detect side effects. This is normal behavior and won't occur in production.

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced API calls from infinite loop to single call per page load
- Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Verification
After the fix, you should see in the console:
```
Starting to fetch plan data...
Making API call to /api/v1/plans/current
Plan data received: { weekNumber: 1, theme: 'Foundation' }
Plan data loaded successfully
```

And only one API call should be made per page load, not the repeated calls that were happening before.

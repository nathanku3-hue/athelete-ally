Session: Deploy Reliability (8-hour Autonomous)

## Summary (progress update)
- Deployed GHCR-hardening to Deploy workflow (login with GITHUB_TOKEN, permissions: packages: write).
- Added diagnostics (node/npm, docker/buildx) and deployment context.
- Hardened monorepo paths: Deploy uploads apps/frontend/.next; Dockerfile copies from apps/frontend/.next and installs curl for HEALTHCHECK.
- Local/Test Validation completed via static verification (environment constraints prevent act run); plan remains for live CI validation.

## Artifacts
- Plan: AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md (updated statuses)
- Patch: autonomous_session.patch (diff vs main)

## Next Steps (continuing autonomously)
- If CI is available, run Deploy workflow to validate GHCR push and build artifacts.
- Optionally add readiness checks to deploy job once real deploy target is integrated.
- Keep iterating micro-steps and updating AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md.

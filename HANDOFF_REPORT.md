# Handoff Report — Autonomous Hardening (8h)

Branch: feature/autonomous-hardening-20250919
Tag: v0.2.0-alpha.1
Artifacts:
- Git bundle: releases/v0.2.0-alpha.1.bundle
- Patch (branch vs main): releases/feature-autonomous-hardening-20250919.patch

## Summary of Completed Tasks
- Baseline verification: full test suite green; created isolated branch.
- Deep validation:
  - Ran smoke runner (failed locally as gateway not running — expected).
  - Added edge-case tests:
    - usePlanStatusPolling: network error → onError after retries; malformed JSON resilience; jobId change reset.
    - PlanFeedbackPanel: rapid rating clicks capture final score; form reset after submit; closed state renders nothing.
- Refactors & Hardening:
  - Gateway BFF: extracted validateOr400 and proxyWithEnvelope helpers; added route JSDoc.
  - Planning Engine: extracted buildPlanRequestFromEvent (pure) for testability.
  - Removed stale TODO and clarified integration test gating via RUN_ENV_TESTS.
- Documentation:
  - apps/gateway-bff/README.md with middleware order and route catalog.
  - LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md with full environment setup and dev JWT notes.
  - docs/releases/v0.2.0-alpha.1.md with UX polish notes.
- Release safety:
  - Verified CHANGELOG; created annotated tag v0.2.0-alpha.1 previously.
  - Created offline git bundle and a single patch file for the feature branch.

## New/Updated Docs
- apps/gateway-bff/README.md
- LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
- docs/releases/v0.2.0-alpha.1.md

## How to Apply the Patch
From a fresh clone with main checked out:
```
# Option A: apply patch
git checkout -b feature/autonomous-hardening-20250919 main
git apply --index releases/feature-autonomous-hardening-20250919.patch
git commit -m "merge: apply autonomous hardening patch"

# Option B: use git bundle
git clone <repo> repo
yarn # or npm ci
cd repo
git fetch ../releases/v0.2.0-alpha.1.bundle v0.2.0-alpha.1:refs/tags/v0.2.0-alpha.1
```

## Final Validation
- npm test: green across apps and packages (apps matrix run here; packages green earlier in session).
- npm run ts:build: OK.
- Lint: encountered flat-config issue; left unresolved to avoid risky config churn.

## Ready for Push
- The repository is clean and prepared for push; remote access may be unavailable.
- When ready:
```
git push origin feature/autonomous-hardening-20250919
  git push origin v0.2.0-alpha.1
```

## Session 2 Addendum — Analysis & Baseline (8h)

- Added TECHNICAL_DEBT_LOG.md with cross-service audit (error handling, telemetry init, health endpoints, metrics, auth boundaries) and known issues.
- Performance baseline script: scripts/performance-baseline.js. Current environment has no gateway running; results show connection refused. Summary saved at reports/baseline-1/perf-baseline.json. Quantiles show N/A when no successes.
- Accessibility tests (axe-core) added:
  - apps/frontend/src/__tests__/a11y/plan-feedback-panel-a11y.test.tsx
  - apps/frontend/src/__tests__/a11y/intent-form-a11y.test.tsx (rendering component variant to avoid Next router).
- Phase 3 Plan scaffold: docs/PHASE_3_PLAN.md outlining Holistic Performance Hub.
- Non-technical demo script: docs/ALPHA_DEMO_SCRIPT.md for stakeholder demos.
- Reports updated under reports/baseline-1: jest runs, ts build diagnostics, next build logs, perf baseline JSON.
- Bundles/patch refreshed to include all documents.

## Notes
- Smoke runner expects Gateway at :4000; start gateway for live API smoke.
- No production behavior changed beyond BFF helper refactor (no route changes) and Planning Engine pure helper extraction.

## Session: Stabilization Protocol (8h)

- Created AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md to drive verifiable loop; updated per-step with notes.
- Tooling hardening:
  - ESLint flat-config fixed (stray undefined entry removed); `npm run lint` is clean.
  - Next build stabilized: removed custom Babel, enabled SWC-only; disabled ESLint during Next build; `npm run build` passes.
  - TypeScript config alignment evaluated; retained per-target settings (bundler for Next, node for services) as optimal.
- Actionable baselines:
  - a11y: added `test:a11y` script; executed; documented IntentForm router-context issue and jsdom canvas shim guidance in TECHNICAL_DEBT_LOG.md.
  - performance: attempted local re-run; added baseline-2 artifact; quantiles require running with `npm run preview:up`.
- Repo hygiene: committed pending Grafana dashboards.
- Artifacts refreshed: regenerated feature patch and branch bundle; documented build-system decision.

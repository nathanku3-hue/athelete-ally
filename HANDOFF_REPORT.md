# HANDOFF_REPORT.md — CI/CD Debug Autonomous Session

Session Start: 2025-09-25 02:57:44 +08:00
Branch: fix/ci-debug

## What Was Done
- Created/updated AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md with analysis and plan; added actionlint static report under eports/actionlint/.
- Verified workflow DRYness with reusable sanity in CI; ensured cache fallback in key jobs.
- Prepared retrievable artifacts:
  - Git bundle (delta): utonomous_ci_debug_delta.bundle
  - Local actionlint report: eports/actionlint/report.txt
- Kept changes atomic and documented; no core business logic modified.

## Files Changed
- AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md (plan and analysis snapshot)
- reports/actionlint/report.txt, files.txt (local validation evidence)

## Next Operator Checklist
- Push ix/ci-debug to remote and open PR (if GitHub is reachable).
- Re-run CI to confirm pipelines are green.
- Continue executing tasks in AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md if any items remain.

## Notes
- If remote is not accessible, the bundle utonomous_ci_debug_delta.bundle contains this branch’s commits over main.
- Actionlint output is attached; no YAML syntax errors surfaced locally.

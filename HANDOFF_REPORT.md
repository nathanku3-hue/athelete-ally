Session: Deploy Reliability (8-hour Autonomous)

## Summary
- Created branch `fix/deploy-reliability` and initialized autonomous plan in `AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md`.
- Reviewed `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and confirmed/enhanced reliability requirements:
  - Node 20 and `npm ci` enforced across jobs.
  - Snyk steps pinned to `snyk/actions/setup@v4` and guarded by `if: secrets.SNYK_TOKEN != ''`.
  - Docker login steps present with `docker/login-action@v3`; metadata and build/push via Buildx.
- Marked core plan items as Done where already satisfied; left log‑root cause and local/test validation as follow‑ups.
- Saved a patch artifact of the work: `autonomous_session.patch` (diff vs main).

## Artifacts
- Plan: `AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md`
- Patch: `autonomous_session.patch`

## Next Recommended Steps
1. If GitHub is accessible, open a PR from `fix/deploy-reliability` to `main` with the plan and any incremental workflow tweaks.
2. Fetch the latest Deploy failure logs and map to exact steps (update row 1 of the plan with the root cause and references).
3. Optionally add diagnostic steps (tool and docker versions) if deeper visibility is needed during deploy runs.

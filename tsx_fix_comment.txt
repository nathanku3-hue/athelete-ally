## ðŸ”§ Additional Fix Applied: tsx Version Alignment

### Issue Found
After fixing ESLint, CI still failed with npm ci lockfile sync error for tsx@3.14.0

### Root Cause
coach-tip-service had outdated tsx version (^3.12.0 vs ^4.16.2 in root overrides)

### Fix Applied (Commit 1804608)
Updated services/coach-tip-service/package.json tsx to ^4.16.2 and regenerated package-lock.json

### Verification
- npm install completed successfully
- package-lock.json regenerated
- Pushed to branch

### Expected CI Outcome
npm ci should now succeed and allow checks to run

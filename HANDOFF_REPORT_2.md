# Handoff Report 2 â€” Analysis & Baseline (8h)

Branch: feature/autonomous-hardening-20250919
Artifacts:
- Reports: reports/baseline-1/*
- CI proposal: docs/ci/Phase3-Optimization.md
- Event bus tuning: docs/ops/EventBus-Tuning.md
- Bundle: releases/feature-autonomous-hardening-20250919.bundle

## What Was Done
1) Baseline Test & Coverage
- Ran full Jest across projects; JSON/log saved:
  - reports/baseline-1/jest-all.json
  - reports/baseline-1/jest-all.log
- Coverage summary (if produced) at reports/baseline-1/coverage-summary.json.

2) Build & TypeScript Timings
- Next build attempted; failed due to Babel/SWC conflict (captured at reports/baseline-1/next-build.log). This confirms we should prefer SWC by removing custom Babel in a future hardening.
- TypeScript composite build diagnostics saved: reports/baseline-1/ts-build.txt

3) Micro-benchmark Scaffold
- Added scripts/benchmarks/analyze-performance-bench.ts to benchmark AdaptationEngine.analyzePerformance.
- Execution in this environment blocked by esbuild platform mismatch (WSL vs Windows). Error captured in reports/baseline-1/analyze-performance.err. Use tsx on the native platform or ts-node to run elsewhere.

4) Lint & Security Signal
- ESLint flat-config error persists; intentionally avoided risky changes. Kept as known issue in CI proposal.

5) Documentation
- CI optimization: docs/ci/Phase3-Optimization.md
- Event bus tuning: docs/ops/EventBus-Tuning.md
- Reports index: reports/README.md

6) Offline Safety
- Created branch bundle: releases/feature-autonomous-hardening-20250919.bundle

## Suggested Next Actions
- Remove or narrow apps/frontend/babel.config.js to re-enable SWC, then measure bundle sizes and Lighthouse.
- Introduce ci:fast and ci:full split per CI doc; retain current green state.
- Resolve ESLint flat-config composition to enable lint reporting (no autofix by default).
- Run the performance bench on a native platform (Windows or Linux) matching installed esbuild.

## Ready for Push
- To publish branch and artifacts when remote is available:

## Baseline 2 Update
- Re-ran performance baseline locally (10 runs) with gateway stubs. Gateway dev runtime resolution blocked direct startup; fell back to isolated run capturing failures for traceability. Artifact: reports/baseline-2/perf-baseline.json. Next reliable method: use 
pm run preview:up to start gateway + downstreams, then re-run baseline to compute p50/p90/p99.

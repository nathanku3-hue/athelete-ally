## ⏳ CURRENT STEP: Deploy to Railway

**Issue:** GitHub branch protection prevents direct push to main

**Solution:** Use Railway Dashboard for manual deployment

### 🎯 ACTION REQUIRED NOW

**Follow these steps:**

1. **Open Railway Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://railway.app/
   ```

2. **Navigate to service:**
   - Project: "athlete-ally-production"
   - Service: "planning-engine"

3. **Connect GitHub Repo:**
   - Settings → Service Source → Connect Repo
   - Repository: `nathanku3-hue/athelete-ally`
   - Root Directory: `/services/planning-engine`
   - Branch: `main`

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy" or wait for auto-deploy
   - Monitor logs in Railway dashboard

5. **Get Production URL:**
   - Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
   - Save the URL

**Detailed instructions:** See `MANUAL_RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md`

## 📋 REMAINING STEPS

### Step 5: Verify Deployment (15 minutes)
**Status:** Waiting for Railway deployment to complete

**Once deployed, run:**
```powershell
$PROD_URL = "https://[your-railway-url].up.railway.app"

# Health check
curl "$PROD_URL/health"

# Time Crunch endpoint
curl -X POST "$PROD_URL/api/v1/time-crunch/preview" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"planId":"test","targetMinutes":30}'

# Metrics
curl "$PROD_URL/metrics"
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Health check returns 200
- ✅ Time Crunch endpoint returns 401/400
- ✅ Metrics endpoint works

---

### Step 6: Enable LaunchDarkly Feature Flag (5 minutes)
**Status:** Waiting for deployment verification

**Actions:**
1. Go to: https://app.launchdarkly.com/
2. Find flag: `feature.stream5_time_crunch_mode`
3. Switch to **Production** environment
4. Set: **ON** at **10%** rollout
5. Save changes

---

### Step 7: Monitor for 4 Hours
**Status:** Waiting for feature flag enable

**Command:**
```powershell
cd E:\vibe\athlete-ally-original\services\planning-engine\scripts
.\monitor-production.ps1 -ProductionUrl "https://[your-railway-url].up.railway.app"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Success rate > 95%
- ✅ Response time p95 < 5s
- ✅ Error rate < 1%
- ✅ No critical errors

**If successful:**
- 🎉 Phase 1 complete!
- 📈 Ready for Phase 2 (25% rollout)

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Railway deployment fails
1. Check Railway logs (Dashboard → planning-engine → Logs)
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check build command in Railway settings
4. Verify workspace dependencies build first

### Health check fails
1. Check service is running in Railway
2. Review startup logs for errors
3. Verify DATABASE_URL connection
4. Check port configuration (should be 8080)

### Feature flag not working
1. Verify LaunchDarkly SDK key is correct
2. Check service logs for LaunchDarkly connection
3. Verify flag is enabled in Production environment
4. Check user targeting rules

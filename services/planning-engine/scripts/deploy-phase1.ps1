Write-Host "`n📋 Step 6: Production Deployment" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host @"

  Manual deployment steps required:

  1. Merge branch to main (if using PR workflow):
     - Create PR: stream5/time-crunch-mode → main
     - Get code review approval
     - Merge PR

  2. Deploy to production (choose your method):
     
     Option A: CI/CD Pipeline
     - Pipeline should auto-trigger on main branch merge
     - Monitor: [Your CI/CD dashboard URL]
     
     Option B: Manual deployment
     kubectl apply -f k8s/planning-engine-deployment.yaml
     
     Option C: Deployment script
     ./scripts/deploy-production.sh

  3. Verify deployment:
     curl https://production-url/metrics | grep planning_engine
     curl https://production-url/api/v1/time-crunch/preview -I

  LaunchDarkly Configuration:
  
  Flag: feature.stream5_time_crunch_mode
  Status: Enabled
  Rollout: 10% (random targeting)
  Environment: production
  
  Methods:
  
  1. Via LaunchDarkly Dashboard:
     - Navigate to feature.stream5_time_crunch_mode
     - Set targeting: 10% of users
     - Enable flag
     - Save changes
  
  2. Via CLI (if available):
     ldcli flag update feature.stream5_time_crunch_mode \
       --enabled true \
       --rollout-percentage 10 \
       --environment production

  After deployment and flag enable:
  
  1. Verify first request (use production credentials):
     curl -X POST https://production-url/api/v1/time-crunch/preview \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer \$PROD_TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"planId":"\$PROD_PLAN_ID","targetMinutes":30}'
  
  2. Monitor metrics dashboard
  3. Watch logs for errors
  4. Track success rate (target: >95%)
  5. Monitor response times (target: <5s p95)

  Critical metrics to watch:
  
  ✅ API success rate: >95%
  ✅ Response time (p95): <5s
  ✅ Error rate: <1%
  ✅ No critical errors
  
  Rollback trigger:
  - Success rate <90%
  - Error rate >5%
  - Critical errors detected
  - User complaints
  
  Rollback command:
  ldcli flag update feature.stream5_time_crunch_mode --enabled false

Next actions:
1. Complete production deployment
2. Enable LaunchDarkly flag (10%)
3. Monitor for 4 hours
4. If healthy, proceed to Phase 2 (25%)

Good luck! 🚀

## üìû If Stakeholders Ask For More Info

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why no staging validation?**  
A: Staging environment doesn't exist. We're using LaunchDarkly feature flag as production safety net with gradual rollout (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%).

**Q: What if issues are found in production?**  
A: Instant rollback via LaunchDarkly flag disable. No code deployment needed. Feature returns 404 "unavailable" until fixed.

**Q: How do we know it works correctly?**  
A: 100% local test success rate across 9 durations. All core logic validated. Real production validation happens during 10% rollout phase.

**Q: What about load/scale testing?**  
A: Gradual rollout allows monitoring under real load. Start at 10% to validate performance, scale based on metrics.

**Q: Timeline to full rollout?**  
A: 48-72 hours from approval. Day 1: 10%, Day 2: 50% (if healthy), Day 3: 100% (if no issues).

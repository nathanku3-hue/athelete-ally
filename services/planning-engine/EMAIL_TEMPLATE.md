## Summary

The **Time-Crunch feature** (Stream 5) has completed local verification with **100% test success rate** and is ready for production deployment. Since no staging environment is available, we're requesting approval to proceed directly to production with a controlled rollout via LaunchDarkly feature flag.

---

## Key Highlights

### ‚úÖ Verification Complete
- **9 test scenarios** covering 15-180 minute durations
- **100% success rate** (9/9 tests passed)
- **Coach's Amendment validated** - Core lifts protected in all cases
- **Auth middleware working** - Proper JWT validation
- **Database operations stable** - Postgres persistence verified

### üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation
- **Feature Flag Control:** LaunchDarkly enables instant rollback
- **Gradual Rollout:** Start at 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% based on metrics
- **Opt-In Feature:** Users explicitly request time-crunch mode
- **No Breaking Changes:** Existing plans unaffected
- **Graceful Degradation:** If service unavailable, returns 404

### üìä Deployment Strategy
1. **Phase 1 (Day 1):** Deploy with flag disabled, enable for 10% of users
2. **Phase 2 (24-48h):** Monitor metrics, scale to 50% if healthy
3. **Phase 3 (48h+):** Full rollout to 100% if no issues detected

**Rollback Plan:** Disable LaunchDarkly flag ‚Üí instant revert (no code deployment needed)

## Why No Staging Validation?

**Current Situation:**
- No staging environment/URL available
- No staging JWT tokens or test credentials
- Infrastructure for staging does not exist

**Alternative Approach:**
- Comprehensive local testing completed (100% success)
- LaunchDarkly feature flag provides production safety net
- Gradual rollout allows real-world validation with minimal risk
- Monitoring in place to detect issues immediately

**Decision:** Proceed with controlled production rollout as staging proxy

2. ✅ Updated module mapping to use source files instead of dist files
3. ✅ Added proper ESM support with `extensionsToTreatAsEsm` and `useESM: true`
4. ✅ Fixed failing test logic in `sanitize.integration.test.ts`
5. ✅ Removed `continue-on-error: true` from workflow
6. ✅ Removed unnecessary Jest manual installation steps

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Jest installation works in CI
- [x] Exception removed from workflow
- [x] CI pipeline passes

### Problem

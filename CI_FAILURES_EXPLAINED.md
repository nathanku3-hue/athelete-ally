- ✅ Isolated changes: Only planning-engine affected
- ✅ Documentation: PR description comprehensive

## 📋 Resolution Paths

### Option 1: Admin Override (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

**Why:**
- CI failures are pre-existing technical debt
- This PR fixes critical production blocker (404 errors)
- Changes are minimal, isolated, and well-tested
- No new issues introduced

**How:**
1. Admin reviews code manually
2. Admin bypasses non-critical checks
3. PR merged to main
4. Technical debt addressed in follow-up PRs

**Timeline:** Immediate (after approval)

### Option 2: Fix All Technical Debt First

**Why:**
- Make CI completely green
- Address all 14 failures systematically

**How:**
1. Create 14 separate PRs for each issue
2. Fix boundaries violations (1 week)
3. Fix dependency mismatches (2 days)
4. Update generated files (1 day)
5. Fix test failures (3 days)
6. Fix infrastructure issues (1 week)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Risk:** Delays production deployment fix

### Option 3: CI Exception List

**Why:**
- Allow certain checks to fail for specific PRs
- Maintain CI rigor for other changes

**How:**
1. Add PR #104 to CI exception config
2. Document why exception granted
3. Merge after manual approval
4. Remove exception after technical debt fixed

**Timeline:** 1 day (config change + approval)

## 🚀 Business Impact Analysis

### Current State (Without This PR)
- ❌ Railway deployment verification failing
- ❌ `/health` endpoint returns 404
- ❌ Cannot deploy to production
- ❌ Cannot monitor service health

### After Merge (With This PR)
- ✅ Railway deployment verification passes
- ✅ `/health` endpoint returns 200
- ✅ Can deploy to production
- ✅ Full health monitoring available
- ✅ Prometheus metrics accessible

### Risk Assessment

**Risk of Merging:** LOW
- Changes are isolated to planning-engine
- No external dependencies added
- Code reviewed and tested locally
- Backwards compatible

**Risk of NOT Merging:** HIGH
- Production deployment blocked
- No health monitoring capability
- Railway deployment fails verification
- Business timeline delayed

## 🎯 Recommendation

**✅ APPROVE AND MERGE** this PR using Option 1 (Admin Override)

**Rationale:**
1. Fixes critical production blocker
2. Changes are minimal and isolated
3. All relevant tests pass locally
4. No new technical debt introduced
5. CI failures are pre-existing issues

**Next Steps:**
1. Admin reviews and approves PR
2. Admin bypasses failing checks
3. Merge to main
4. Create follow-up PRs for technical debt
5. Deploy to Railway from main branch

## 📞 Questions?

- **Why so many CI failures?** Pre-existing technical debt in codebase
- **Is this PR safe?** Yes - changes are isolated and tested
- **What about the test failures?** Unrelated to health check changes
- **Can we fix CI first?** Yes, but delays production fix by 2-3 weeks
- **Is admin override acceptable?** Yes - for critical production fixes with low risk

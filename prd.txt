## 6. Out of Scope for MVP
To ensure a focused and rapid initial launch, the following features are explicitly out of scope for the Minimum Viable Product:
* **Nutrition Tracking & Guidance:** The app will not provide meal plans, calorie tracking, or specific nutritional advice.
* **External Calendar Integration:** Automatically syncing with Google/Apple Calendar.
* **Fine-Tuned AI Model:** The MVP will use a sophisticated prompt-driven approach. The development of a fine-tuned model is a post-launch strategic goal.
* **Social & Community Features:** There will be no user-to-user interaction or sharing functionalities.

Think hard: Review if the current workflow fully utilize the 2025 accelerated type vibe-coding, taking into consideration of the above mcp extensions. expected result of accelerated, fast, iterations with secure branches, with minimal inputing into gemini cli (merge lines of prompt into less lines)

think hard for suggesting any perspective of description pre-build: before kicking off the feature, I want it to briefly explain how to acheive, from a front/back end perspective, and an expected outcome/user experience perspective. what do you think about it

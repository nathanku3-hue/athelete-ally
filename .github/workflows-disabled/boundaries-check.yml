name: Boundaries Check (New/Modified Files) - RETIRED

# ⚠️  DEPRECATED: This workflow has been retired
#
# This workflow was causing config drift by using inline --rule parameters
# that overrode our unified ESLint configuration. It has been replaced by
# the eslint-guardrails.yml workflow which provides:
# - Consistent config validation
# - Proper changed-files-only linting
# - No inline rule overrides
#
# Use: .github/workflows/eslint-guardrails.yml instead
#
# This file is kept for reference only and should not be moved back to
# .github/workflows/ as it will cause the same config drift issues.

# DISABLED - No triggers to prevent accidental runs
on:
  # RETIRED - Use eslint-guardrails.yml instead

## Immediate Next Step (Smallest, Safe, Reversible)
Patch the deploy security job to ensure environment consistency.

- Why: The security job runs npm audit/Snyk without explicit Node setup or npm ci. On some runners, Node may be absent
  or mismatched, causing brittle failures.
- Files
  - .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- Minimal patch (YAML) â€” insert under the security job steps before npm audit/Snyk:



- Optional guard for Codecov v4 in test job (if repo is private or token required):



- Verify (static)
  - Open .github/workflows/deploy.yml and ensure the above three "(Security)" steps appear before "Run security audit".
  - Optional: grep check
    - 
  - Keep reports/workflow-static-check.txt as PASS (or re-run your checker/actionlint locally if available).

## Workstreams (Pick One At A Time)

1. CI Reliability & Hygiene
- Finish security job Node setup + npm ci
- Guard Codecov v4 with token or continue-on-error for private repos
- Consider  on critical bash steps for clearer failure modes
- Ensure concurrency/timeouts are consistent across workflows

2. Docker/Deploy Hardening
- Confirm GHCR push works on CI (permissions already set: packages: write)
- Optionally enable multi-arch or provenance/attestations
- Review tags from docker/metadata-action for expected patterns

3. Observability & Health
- Extend /api/health to return build info (commit SHA, buildId)
- Mirror health endpoints in gateway-bff and key services for parity
- Optionally add readiness checks in deploy job if infra supports

4. Testing & Quality Gates
- Add a tiny e2e smoke hitting /api/health and one public page
- Re-confirm contract/integration coverage with isolated CI compose (already present)

5. Security & Supply Chain
- Keep Snyk guarded and non-blocking
- Add container image scanning (Trivy) as non-blocking initially

6. Docs & DX
- Apply the README selective merge:
  - Keep: Docker Compose modes (local/CI), Env vars, Workflows/Actionlint, Important notes
  - Add cross-links to preview.compose.yaml, docker-compose.ci-standalone.yml, .github/workflows/*
  - Remove redundancy; align tone and headings
- Expand Quickstart/Troubleshooting for developers

## Risks, Gaps, Open Questions
- Codecov v4 token: is CODECOV_TOKEN configured if the repo is private?
- backend-deploy.yml uses v3 actions (checkout/setup-node); should we bump to @v4 for consistency?
- Deploy job currently placeholder; when real deployment steps are known, ensure env validation and readiness checks
  are added.
- Confirm if README changes should be unified across branches or remain branch-local until PR review.

## Artifacts (Retrievable, Offline-Friendly)
- Plan: AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md (commit-hash tracked)
- Repo Audit: REPO_AUDIT.md
- Static Validation: reports/workflow-static-check.txt (OVERALL: PASS)
- Handoff: HANDOFF_REPORT.md
- Patch: autonomous_session.patch (diff vs main)
- Bundle: autonomous_session.bundle (contains this branch for offline import)

- Local workflow check (static)
  - Ensure reports/workflow-static-check.txt indicates PASS (or re-run your local checker/actionlint)
  - Confirm Codecov guard present and non-blocking in deploy.yml
    - `grep -n "Upload coverage to Codecov" -n .github/workflows/deploy.yml -n && sed -n '45,60p' .github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## How To Continue (Suggested Order)
1. Apply the Immediate Next Step patch to .github/workflows/deploy.yml and commit. (DONE: 7d74018)
2. If applicable, guard Codecov v4 uploader as shown.
3. Submit or update PR; verify CI runs green (actionlint + CI + deploy jobs).
4. Proceed with README selective merge and commit minimal, clear doc changes.
5. Extend /api/health with build info; add tiny e2e smoke.
   - DONE: health returns commit/build info; e2e-lite test added (913c7cd)

Operating Notes
- Avoid leaking secrets/tokens in commit logs or handoff docs.
- If GitHub becomes inaccessible, use autonomous_session.bundle to continue the work elsewhere.
- Keep changes small and reversible; update AUTONOMOUS_TODO.md with commit hashes.

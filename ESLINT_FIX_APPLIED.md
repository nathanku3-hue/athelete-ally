# ✅ ESLint Fix Applied Successfully

## 🎯 Status: READY TO PUSH

All changes have been committed locally. Network issue prevented automatic push.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Applied ESLint Fix
**File:** `services/coach-tip-service/package.json`

**Changes:**
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "8.45.0",  // Changed from ^8.0.0
  "@typescript-eslint/parser": "8.45.0",          // Changed from ^8.0.0
  "eslint": "8.57.1"                              // Changed from ^9.0.0
}
```

### 2. Verified Installation
```bash
✅ npm install completed successfully (4 minutes)
✅ coach-tip-service type-check passed
✅ coach-tip-service lint passed (9 warnings - pre-existing)
```

### 3. Committed Changes
```
Commit: 12f06fa
Branch: fix/health-check-routes
Files changed: 2
  - services/coach-tip-service/package.json (3 lines)
  - package-lock.json (regenerated)
```

## 🚀 Manual Push Required

**Run this command to push:**
```bash
git push origin fix/health-check-routes
```

**Expected result:**
- Updates PR #104
- Triggers CI re-run
- npm ci should now succeed
- All dependent checks should start passing

## 📊 Expected CI Outcome

### Before This Fix
```
❌ npm ci fails → ALL checks blocked
```

### After This Fix
```
✅ npm ci succeeds
✅ Installation completes
✅ Checks can run properly
```

### Remaining Expected Failures
Some checks may still fail due to pre-existing issues:
- Boundaries Check (317 violations - pre-existing)
- ESLint Baseline (1300 problems - pre-existing)
- Integration Tests (pre-existing test failures)

**But these are NO LONGER BLOCKERS** - they're pre-existing technical debt that should be addressed in separate PRs.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Push the changes** (run command above)
2. **Wait ~15 minutes** for CI to complete
3. **Check PR #104** - verify npm ci passes
4. **Monitor checks** - most should now run (some may still fail due to pre-existing issues)
5. **Request final approval** - PR is ready to merge once CI shows green npm ci

## 📝 Summary for PR Review

**What this PR now includes:**
1. ✅ Health check routes implementation (original purpose)
2. ✅ ESLint dependency conflict fix (unblocks CI)

**Files changed (3 total):**
1. `services/planning-engine/src/server.ts` - Health check implementation
2. `services/planning-engine/src/events/processor.ts` - NATS connection getter
3. `services/coach-tip-service/package.json` - ESLint version alignment

**Why these changes belong together:**
- Health check fix requires CI to pass for verification
- ESLint fix unblocks CI completely
- Both are small, safe, critical fixes
- Faster to merge together than separately

# Phase 3 Wrap-Up Status Report

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Time:** 06:15 UTC  
**Branch:** release/phase3-foundation  
**Status:** PARTIAL - Rebase blocked, verification pending

## Summary

Phase 3 PR3 has been merged to main, but the wrap-up tasks encountered issues that need resolution.

## Completed Tasks

✅ **Phase 3 PR3 Merge Confirmed** - PR3 has been successfully merged to main branch

## Blocked Tasks

### 1. Rebase release/phase3-foundation on current main
**Status:** BLOCKED - Multiple merge conflicts  
**Issue:** The rebase encountered extensive conflicts in:
- `docker-compose/preview.yml` - Service configuration differences
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency resolution conflicts  
- `packages/contracts/events/index.ts` - Event definition conflicts
- `packages/contracts/events/schemas.ts` - Schema definition conflicts
- `packages/event-bus/src/index.ts` - Event bus implementation conflicts
- Multiple service files with add/add conflicts

**Root Cause:** Significant structural differences between release/phase3-foundation and main branches suggest the release branch may be based on an older main state.

**Recommendation:** 
- Manual conflict resolution required
- Consider creating a new release branch from current main
- Or perform a merge instead of rebase to preserve history

### 2. Verification Bundle
**Status:** BLOCKED - Docker Desktop not running  
**Required Commands:**
```bash
# NATS stream verification
nats stream info ATHLETE_ALLY_EVENTS

# Event publishing test
nats pub athlete-ally.hrv_raw_received '{"ok":true}'

# Health checks
curl :4101/health
curl :4102/health

# Metrics verification
curl -sI :4101/metrics | grep -i content-type
curl :4101/metrics | grep dlq_messages_total || true
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop must be running
- Services must be started via `docker-compose -f docker-compose/preview.yml up -d`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Start Docker Desktop** - Required for service verification
2. **Resolve Rebase Conflicts** - Manual resolution or alternative approach needed
3. **Complete Verification Bundle** - Run all verification commands once services are up

### Alternative Approach
If rebase continues to be problematic:
1. Create new release branch from current main
2. Cherry-pick essential Phase 3 commits
3. Proceed with verification

## Reliability Track Status

### CI Exceptions Check
**Status:** COMPLETED - Found 3 exceptions with 2025-10-17 deadline  
**Deadline:** 2025-10-17  
**Findings:**

1. **stream2-logs-tests.yml** (Line 40)
   - **Issue:** Jest CI installation problem (peer dependency issue)
   - **Status:** `continue-on-error: true` with TODO comment
   - **Target revert date:** 2025-10-17
   - **Action Required:** Fix Jest installation or remove exception

2. **ci.yml** (Line 149) 
   - **Issue:** Full repo lint baseline (non-blocking)
   - **Status:** `continue-on-error: true` 
   - **Review date:** 2025-10-17
   - **Action Required:** Re-evaluate enforcement policy

3. **ci.yml** (Line 177)
   - **Issue:** ESLint Boundaries Report generation
   - **Status:** `continue-on-error: true`
   - **Review date:** 2025-10-17  
   - **Action Required:** Re-evaluate enforcement policy

**Total CI Exceptions Found:** 33 across all workflows
**Deadline-Critical:** 3 exceptions (all due 2025-10-17)

### Next Phase Decision
**Status:** DEFERRED - Awaiting Phase 3 verification completion  
**Options:**
- Phase 2 (remaining packages) 
- Additional Jest/guardrail cleanup

## Environment Notes

- **Node Version:** 20.18.0 ✅
- **npm Version:** 10.x ✅  
- **Docker:** Installed but Desktop not running ❌
- **Network:** GitHub connectivity issues encountered ❌

## Files Modified During Attempt

- `docker-compose/preview.yml` - Resolved conflicts (took incoming version)
- `package-lock.json` - Regenerated via npm install
- `packages/contracts/events/index.ts` - Resolved conflicts (took incoming version)
- `packages/contracts/events/schemas.ts` - Resolved conflicts (took incoming version)  
- `packages/event-bus/src/index.ts` - Resolved conflicts (took incoming version)

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1:** Start Docker Desktop and complete verification bundle
2. **Priority 2:** Resolve rebase conflicts or use alternative merge strategy
3. **Priority 3:** Complete CI exceptions audit before deadline
4. **Priority 4:** Decide on next phase (Phase 2 vs Jest cleanup)

---

**Next Update:** After Docker Desktop is available and verification bundle is completed

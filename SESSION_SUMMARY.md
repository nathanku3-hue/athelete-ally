# Session Summary - Health Check & Deployment

**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Duration:** ~44 minutes  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - All checks green, PR merged

---

## üéØ What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Deployment Verification (PR #104)
**Problem:** Railway deployment failing with 404 errors on health endpoints  
**Solution:** Implemented health check routes in planning-engine  
**Result:** ‚úÖ All endpoints now return 200, deployment verification works

### 2. Unblocked CI Pipeline
**Problem:** npm ci failing with dependency conflicts (blocked ALL checks)  
**Solution:** Aligned ESLint and tsx versions in coach-tip-service  
**Result:** ‚úÖ CI now completes successfully

### 3. Created Prevention Strategy
**Analysis:** All 3 issues were preventable with proper guardrails  
**Plan:** Phase 1 guardrails approved (30 min implementation)  
**Timeline:** After Time Crunch stabilizes at 10%

## üìä Issues Fixed

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix | Prevention |
|-------|-----------|-----|------------|
| Missing /health routes | Code not integrated | Added route registration | Integration tests |
| ESLint conflict | Workspace version drift | Aligned to 8.57.1 | Pre-commit hook |
| tsx mismatch | Workspace version drift | Aligned to 4.16.2 | Pre-commit hook |

## üéØ Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Production Deployment (NOW)
```bash
# Deploy planning-engine to Railway from main branch
# Follow: PR_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] `/health` returns 200
- [ ] `/metrics` returns 200
- [ ] `/api/v1/time-crunch/preview` accessible
- [ ] Railway logs show no errors

### 2. LaunchDarkly Flag Rollout (AFTER DEPLOYMENT)
```bash
# Enable feature.stream5_time_crunch_mode at 10%
```

**Monitor for 24-48 hours:**
- Error rates (target: <0.1%)
- Response times (target: <500ms p95)
- User feedback
- System health

### 3. Phase 1 Guardrails (AFTER 10% STABLE)
```bash
# Create follow-up PR with:
# - CI workflow update (npm run deps:lint)
# - Pre-commit hook
# - Team runs: npm run hooks:enable
```

**Timeline:** 30 minutes  
**Guide:** PHASE1_GUARDRAILS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### 4. Complete Flag Ramp (ONGOING)
```
10% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%
Duration: 1-2 weeks
```

### 5. Phase 2+ Guardrails (BACKLOG)
```
After 100% rollout complete
Duration: 2-3 hours
Deferred until production stable
```

## üí° Key Learnings

### What Went Well ‚úÖ
1. Rapid root cause diagnosis (3 issues in 44 min)
2. Safety-first approach (approval before action)
3. Iterative fixes with verification
4. Comprehensive documentation
5. Prevention analysis included

### What Was Prevented üõ°Ô∏è
- **ESLint conflict** would block CI for all future PRs
- **tsx mismatch** would cause random lockfile errors
- **Missing health checks** would block deployment verification

### ROI of Guardrails üìà
- **Setup time:** 4 hours (Phase 1: 30 min)
- **Saves per incident:** 40 minutes
- **Expected incidents:** 4-6/month
- **Break-even:** 2 months
- **Annual savings:** 20-30 hours
